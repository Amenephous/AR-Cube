# AR-Cube
Welcome to the Augmented Reality Cube with ARuco Codes project! This repository contains code for creating an augmented reality cube using ARuco markers. The project utilizes computer vision techniques to detect ARuco markers in a camera feed and overlays a virtual cube onto the detected markers, creating an immersive augmented reality experience.
